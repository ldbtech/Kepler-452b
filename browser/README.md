# KeplerV Native Intent Browser

KeplerV is a macOS Tauri 2 application organized around user goals, agent work, and human review. This project extends the existing Svelte Intent Space with a managed local Universal Agent Runtime (UAR), Meta Muse, a permissioned research browser, and a persistent event/evidence store.

## Run the desktop app

Requirements: macOS, Xcode Command Line Tools, Rust stable, Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+, and Python 3.12+.

```sh
cd /Users/alidaho/Projects/keplerv/browser
npm install
python3.12 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r runtime/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python -m playwright install chromium
```

Connect Meta Muse from LLM providers in the app. KeplerV saves the credential in the macOS Keychain and passes it from its native process to the local Python runtime; it is not stored with workspace data or sent to browser pages. Environment variables remain available for development and automation.

```sh
export MODEL_API_KEY="your Meta Model API key"
npm run desktop
```

The app starts a Python sidecar on `127.0.0.1` using a fresh, app-scoped random bearer token. Tauri stops the sidecar when the desktop process exits. Run `npm run dev` to work on the Svelte interface alone; runtime controls require the native desktop app. Build the macOS app bundle with `npm run desktop:build`.

The current `.app` bundle includes the Python runtime source, but does not bundle a Python interpreter, installed Python packages, or Playwright's Chromium binary. For a packaged app, install the Python requirements and Chromium on that Mac and set `KEPLERV_PYTHON` to the Python environment that contains them. The bundled app does not yet install these dependencies automatically.

`.env.example` lists the supported environment variable names. It is a template, not loaded automatically; set the variables in the shell that launches KeplerV. `KEPLERV_PYTHON` can point the native app to a specific Python executable if you do not use the project's `.venv`.

## Research flow

1. Create/select a goal in the existing Intent Space and open its details.
2. Provide a public HTTPS article URL. The user-provided URL establishes the exact host and port the agent may access.
3. Start Muse research. The runtime persists an agent/run record and begins an asynchronous model/tool loop.
4. Muse can navigate, inspect, extract text, and take a screenshot in an isolated headless Chromium context. Page clicks and form fills require per-action approval.
5. KeplerV records runtime events and source-quoted findings in local SQLite, associates them with the goal, and updates the existing graph/activity surfaces.
6. Pause, resume, stop, review approvals, and inspect findings from the goal/agent panels.

The model cannot grant itself permissions. AIP checks agent/run identity, goal, capability, tool, authorized origin, public DNS resolution, delegation limits, and approval before a tool runs. The browser permits requests only to the selected origin; untrusted pages do not have Tauri IPC access. Delegated agents inherit the goal and source origin with reduced permissions, bounded child count, depth, step, and token budgets.

## Runtime settings

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MODEL_API_KEY` | unset | Meta Model API credential; required for live Muse calls |
| `KEPLERV_MODEL_PROVIDER` | `meta` | Runtime adapter selection; only `meta` has a live adapter in this milestone |
| `KEPLERV_MODEL_NAME` | `muse-spark-1.3` | Model identifier sent to the Meta API |
| `KEPLERV_PYTHON` | project `.venv`, then Python 3.12, then `python3` | Runtime interpreter override |

Provider settings can connect Meta Muse, OpenAI-compatible services, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, OpenRouter, Groq, Mistral, Ollama, LM Studio, and compatible local endpoints. Cloud connections are checked against the provider's available models before their keys are saved in Keychain. OpenAI-compatible services use Chat Completions; Anthropic, Gemini, and ChatGPT use their respective request formats. ChatGPT uses OpenAI's published local-app OAuth flow, including PKCE, state/nonce checks, signed identity-token validation, keychain token storage, refresh, and optional plan-usage authorization. The runtime selects the connected provider and model for new research runs.

## Verify

```sh
npm run test:runtime
npm run test:browser
npm test
npm run build
cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```

The deterministic Python workflow exercises orchestration, AIP denial, event persistence, and source-checked evidence. A separate browser integration test below uses real Playwright Chromium. A live Meta API call requires internet access and `MODEL_API_KEY`.

Run `npm run test:browser` to exercise the scheduler and event/evidence store against a real Playwright Chromium session and the public Python documentation site. The Python suite also includes a full live Muse + Chromium workflow. It runs automatically when `MODEL_API_KEY` is present and is skipped otherwise; that test makes real requests to Meta and the public article.

## What is operational and what remains simulated

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell and Intent Space | Native Tauri 2 + Svelte application; existing goal graph and panels are reused |
| Local UAR | Real FastAPI sidecar, token-authenticated loopback API, asynchronous agent lifecycle, pause/resume/stop, SQLite persistence |
| Muse | Real Meta API adapter using `MODEL_API_KEY`, configurable model name, tool-call normalization, timeouts and visible errors; live request not tested without credentials |
| Research browser | Isolated Playwright/Chromium context, exact-origin request filtering, typed browser tools; actual Chromium launch not proven by the fake-browser tests |
| AIP | Deterministic Python authorization for supported tools; experimental, not a production security protocol |
| Events and evidence | Runtime-generated structured records persisted locally and reflected in the current UI |
| Provider connections | Cloud credentials are saved in macOS Keychain; provider settings and local model endpoints stay on-device; ChatGPT account tokens are refreshed and used only when plan usage was authorized |
| Voice transcription | Still a labeled selectable demonstration; no speech-to-text model is connected |
| UB schedule PDF | Existing guided product demonstration; it is not produced by the research runtime |
| Legacy sample goals/agents and guard scenario | Existing local demonstration data and simulation paths remain |

The native resource-window feature remains separate from the agent research browser. A research agent uses its isolated Playwright context and does not open conventional tabs in the user's visible window.

## Project structure

- `src/App.svelte` — Intent Space, goal/agent panels, runtime event integration, and existing audio/plan flows.
- `src/simulation/` — existing goal graph behavior and explicitly local demonstration scenarios.
- `runtime/` — FastAPI sidecar, Meta adapter, agent scheduler, AIP, Playwright browser gateway, SQLite store, and tests.
- `src-tauri/src/runtime_bridge.rs` — managed sidecar process, random token, authenticated native requests, and typed event polling.
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — Tauri command registration and sidecar lifecycle.
- `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` — IPC permissions scoped to the local `main` window.
